# TOP-Rock-Paper-Scissors-project

Started with function that determens the round winner and a function for
random string(rock/papper/scissors). Just need to finish the function 
for couning wins and final winner.

I just finished writing the script. I tested the app using console and
it works! This is the first one I made on my own with a little bit of 
googleing for some information about functions. Main tchnologies  I used
were functions, if/else statments and a loop. The code may be a little messy
because maybe my eyes are not familiar with the clean cod yet, but
I belive that will change in the future.
